make loopback API:
    with appropriate models

interact with the loopback api via frontend

front end works with get and post APIs

Due to the fact that I was sick, I do not have anymore time to allocate to this test. 
As previously mentioned to Andrea, I was told that I can work on this on the weekend. 
I will be posting my recording on youtube, with a link on GitHub, and a repository on GitHub.

Thank you for your time. I really appreciate you considering/ considered me for the position.
